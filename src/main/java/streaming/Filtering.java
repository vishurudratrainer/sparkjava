/**
 * Much of the processing we require on streams is agnostic about batch boundaries. It's convenient to have
 * methods on JavaDStream that allow us to transform the streamed data item by item (using map()), or filter it
 * item by item (using filter()) without being concerned about batch boundaries as embodied by individual RDDs.
 * This example again uses map() to parse the records int he ext files and then filter() to filter out individual
 * entries, so that by the time we receive batch RDDs only the desired items remain.
 *
 * Of course, similar filtering and transformation methods are available on the JavaRDD class, and its better to
 * use those in the case where your algorithm NEEDS to be aware of batch boundaries. The methods on JavaDStream
 * illustrated here are useful exactly because they abstract batch boundaries away, and also because they
 * create a stream that can be used for additional processing.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you want to transform data in a way that is aware of batch boundaries but still creates a
 * stream, you can uses transform() and similar methods on JavaDStream that are illustrated elsewhere.
